  title: Global Vision
  description: The Computational Biology Core (CBC) is a group of scientists, data
    scientists, and software engineers that support data-intensive research. The near-term,
    primary mission of the CBC is to support junior Investigators in the analysis
    and interpretation of high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing datasets, including data
    generated in their laboratories and large, publicly-available datasets. The Core
    also facilitates scientific interactions among the projects in the COBRE. The
    long-term goal of the CBC is to provide a sustainable resource to support data
    analysis challenges faced by genomic studies across Brown University and our Affiliated
    Hospitals. The Core also provides training for the broad research community to
    ensure the sustainability of the next cohort of junior investigators.
