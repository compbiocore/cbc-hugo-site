  section:
    - title: "# Consulting Services"
      text: "<p>The Core provides two distinct complimentary services  to all researchers at Brown.</p>
             <p><strong>Appointment Based</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;A team of experienced computational biologists and biostatisticians are on-hand to help investigators design experiments.</p>
             <p><strong>Weekly Consulting Sessions</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;The Core offers two weekly Consulting sessions for all researchers to discuss any immediate issues  in data anlysis including trouble-shooting code, help with stiatistical analysis and discussion of options for bioinformatic analysis.</p>"
      text2: "To avail of the consulting services please sign up below if you have not used the CBC services before. Use the scheduler below to reserve a slot for the weekly  consulting sessions and in the event that all slots are filled and you need an appointment sooner contact our **[helpdesk](mailto:cbc-help.brown.edu)**."
