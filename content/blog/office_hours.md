The COBRE Center for Computational Biology of Human Disease (CBHD) will be providing Open Office Hours for bioinformatic and computational consulting by the COBRE Computation Biology Core (CBC) Staff Scientists. If you need help with analyses of genomic-scale data sets such as RNAseq, ChIP- or ATACseq, genome/exome SNP calling, microbiome analyses, etc., the CBC staff is now available to guide you with these analyses.

Why Now? In the first years of the CBHD Center, the services of the CBC Staff have been restricted to the junior faculty Project Leaders supported by the COBRE award. As we prepare for a renewal of the Center, we will transition to an open access Core Facility that is available to anyone. For the next year, we will provide these consulting services at no charge, with the intention to grow this in to a fee-for-service center like any other core facility. This expanded service will give us a better understanding of the bioinformatic needs of the Brown and Hospital communities and allow us to prepare a competitive renewal proposal for Phase II support that will help everyone.

What services are provided? The services that are free of charge will involve a CBC staff member guiding someone in the execution of the desired analyses, and providing instruction in how to perform these analyses on their own. If one needs ongoing independent analyses of data sets, this will require a fee-for-service model, with specific analysis outcomes defined in initial meetings.

Goals of the CBHD COBRE. Our long-term goal is to build a Center that can provide computational and bioinformatic services for genomic analyses to the broader Brown and Hospital communities. A second goal is to increase the capabilities of biomedical researchers in bioinformatic analyses. The Open Office Hours should help meet these goals, as will ongoing Workshops and Seminars supported by the COBRE Center.

How do you get help? CBC Staff will have walk-in office hours every Wednesday from 1:30-3:30 pm in RM 405 BMC (Biomedical Center) on Campus.
